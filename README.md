Job Listing Frontend
====================

This is a simple job listing frontend using [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
Json Server is used as a mock backend for the job listing. 
For more information, please see (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
